# Twitter Sentimental analysis of real time data


i made this code in python 3.6.2 version. Internet connection is required to run this application since it fetches real time tweets from tweeter.

At first you have to get your twitter api keys - consumer_key, Consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret

you can get infromation related to keys from "https://chimpgroup.com/knowledgebase/twitter-api-keys/" or you can search it on youtube........in short you have to publish a dummy app and link it to twitter dev account then you will get your keys

now open tweet.py file and enter all the keys in "def __init__(self)" method 

now you are ready to go...just run the file and enter the topic of search and see the result.

i am attaching the outputs in output.pdf file
